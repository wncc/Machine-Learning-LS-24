> ## What is YOLOv8?
YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a real-time object detection algorithm.It is a single-stage object detector that uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the bounding boxes and class probabilities of objects in input images. The YOLO algorithm divides the input image into a grid of cells, and for each cell, it predicts the probability of the presence of an object and the bounding box coordinates of the object. It also predicts the class of the object. Unlike two-stage object detectors such as R-CNN and its variants, YOLO processes the entire image in one pass, making it faster and more efficient.
